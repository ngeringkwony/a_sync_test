Brutal Doom 64 by Sergeant Mark IV

Installation:
1 - Unzip the content.
2 - Place a doom2.wad file in the main folder. It doesn't matters if you got the file from Steam, Gog.com, whatever,
any official version of the doom2.wad file will work. Final Doom iwads (tnt.wad and plutonia.wad) will also work.
If you don't have it, get it here http://store.steampowered.com/app/2300/
3 - Use "bd64 zandronum.exe" to play. You can make a shortcut of it on your desktop.

For advanced users:
You can extract all files from the skins folder, and make your instalation.
This mod supports any version of GZDoom (including dev buids), or Zandronum (2.1 or higher).

If you already have an older version installed, just delete everything
and use this installation instead. You can't play your old save games
with older versions, but you can use the idclevxx command to start the
game on the map you left (for example if you stoped the game on map10,
just type idclev10).

This installer only works for Windows users. It supports any Windows version.
If you are using Linux or Mac, you need to download a new sourceport, extract all the 3 files
from the skins folder, and configure everything manually.

To play multiplayer you will need Doomseeker.

You can extract the files from the Skins folder and run them on your own installation.
This installation of Zandronum 3.0 alpha that I included has everything configured for optimal performance.
If you are going to move it to your own installation, remember to disable the Enhanced Night Vision Mode.
This instalation is configured for a 1600x900 default resolution, on windowed mode.
You can change it to fullscreen and change it to other resolutions by going
to options > set video mode.
You can run either bd64v1_main with other map packs or vanilla Doom maps, or bd64v1_maps alone to play these maps
with custom gameplay mods.

You can control the amount of blood and gore by opening the console and typing bd_bloodamount * (* is a number from 1 to 4)
You can enable the "janitor" to make blood and gore disappear after some time by typing in the console bd_lowgraphicsmode 1 (type
bd_lowgraphicsmode 0 to disable)
